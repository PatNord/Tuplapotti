# Tuplapotti
I made legendary finnish slotmachine "Tuplapotti" as practice project for course. Here it is:

How it works:
Game is played trough terminal via inputs. Program gives you options what to do and player inserts wanted actions in input.
There is 5 lines where you can win with different combinations.
In the event win, you are prompted "tuplaa" or "voitonmaksu". "Tuplaa" attemps to double the win with coin toss. There is also 1/2, that returns the win without adding the double and - that loses the double.
